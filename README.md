## About
TapSearch is a Flask web application that takes in multiple paragraphs of text, assigns a unique ID To each paragraph and stores the words to paragraph mappings on an inverted index.
Given a word to search for, it lists out the top 10 paragraphs in which the word is present.

## Usage
1. The home page gives you a text area to add your text and a textbox to add the word you want to search.
2. After adding the text to the required fields, click on Index button to preprocess the input and index the inputs into different paragraphs.
3. Click on Search button to find the paragrahs with the highest occurence of the given word.
4. Click on Clear button to clear all the indices that were previously present.
